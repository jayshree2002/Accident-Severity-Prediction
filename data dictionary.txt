The Motor Vehicle Collisions person table contains details for people involved in the crash. 
Each row represents a person (driver, occupant, pedestrian, bicyclist,..) involved in a crash. 
The data in this table goes back to April 2016 when crash reporting switched to an electronic system.

The Motor Vehicle Collisions data tables contain information from all police reported motor vehicle collisions in NYC. 
The police report (MV104-AN) is required to be filled out for collisions where someone is injured or killed, or where there is at least $1000 worth of damage (https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.dot.gov/files/documents/ny_overlay_mv-104an_rev05_2004.pdf). 
It should be noted that the data is preliminary and subject to change when the MV-104AN forms are amended based on revised crash details.
